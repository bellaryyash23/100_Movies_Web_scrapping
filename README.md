# ðŸŽ¬Top 100 Movies Web Scraping using BeautifulSoup of Python

ðŸŒŸA program which makes use of Web Scraping to get the real-time data of titles of the top 100 movies of all time from website using the BeautifulSoup package of Python.

ðŸ‘‰In the 'main.py' file, the requests module is used to get the hard coded html data from the website(https://web.archive.org/web/20211226090047/https://www.empireonline.com/movies/features/best-movies-2/) 
and the response data is then stored in the python variable.

ðŸ‘‰Next the BeautifulSoup Object is called to parse the stored html data for implementing web screaping.

ðŸ‘‰In order to get the list of titles of the movies from this data we need to use the BeautifulSoup method '.find_all()' which takes the html tag name and other parameters
as arguments and returns the HTML tag in its entirety. 

ðŸ‘‰For us to extract the text from the acquired HTML tag we use the '.get_text()' method which returns just the text i.e. the title of the movie tag.

ðŸ‘‰This all data is then appended to a text file which is stored locally, allowing the user to view and edit and track their viewing list.
